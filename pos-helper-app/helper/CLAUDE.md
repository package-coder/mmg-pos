## System Overview

This workspace contains three tightly related projects that together form the **MMG Albay POS System** — a point-of-sale system built for Medical Mission Group Multipurpose Cooperative-Albay (a healthcare clinic cooperative in the Philippines).

| Project | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `pos-helper-app/helper` | (this repo) | Python WebSocket hardware bridge |
| `mmg-app` | `../../mmg-app` (also open in workspace) | React + Vite frontend |
| `pos-api` | `C:/Users/UNC/source/repos/pos-api` | Flask Python REST API + sync + proxy |

### pos-helper-app (this repo) — `helper/app.py`

A standalone Python `asyncio` WebSocket server that bridges the browser to physical hardware.

- Listens on `ws://localhost:9876`
- Receives JSON messages routed by `{ "device": "printer"|"display", "device_type": "..." }`
- Printer device types: `receipt`, `report`, `test`
- Display device types: `message`, `item`, `total`, `next`
- All blocking hardware calls are offloaded with `asyncio.to_thread` to keep the event loop responsive
- `ReceiptWriter` is a context manager that opens `ejournal.txt` once per transaction and writes to both the file and the ESC/POS printer simultaneously — journals to file even when the physical printer is offline
- `ejournal.txt` (in `helper/`) is the electronic transaction log; never opened more than once per print job

### mmg-app — `../../mmg-app/src/`

React 18 + Vite SPA. Key structural layers:

- **`src/api/`** — one Axios module per domain (`transaction.js`, `auth.js`, `print.js`, etc.) using a shared `server` axios instance from `api/index.js` that injects the JWT from `TokenStorage`
- **`src/providers/`** — three React Context providers:
  - `AuthProvider` — JWT auth, user object, selected branch (persisted in `localStorage`)
  - `PrinterProvider` — manages the WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:9876`; exposes `usePrinter()` hook
  - `CashierReportProvider` — cashier shift state
- **`src/routes/`** — React Router v6; four route groups: `MainRoutes` (dashboard/admin), `PosRoutes` (cashier POS screen), `AuthRoutes` (login), `DefaultRoutes` (root redirect). All protected routes use `<AuthorizeRoute roles={[...]}>`.
- **`src/views/pages/PosPage/`** — the active transaction/cashier screen; most hardware interaction happens here via `usePrinter()`
- **`src/store/`** — Redux is used **only** for UI customization (theme). Server state is managed by React Query.
- All pages are lazy-loaded via `Loadable(lazy(...))`.

**Two print paths exist** — know which one you are touching:
1. `usePrinter()` from `PrinterProvider` → WebSocket to helper app (current approach for POS screen)
2. `src/api/print.js` (`Print()`, `PrintReport()`) → HTTP to the proxy `/print` and `/print-report` endpoints (legacy, kept for compatibility)

### pos-api — `C:/Users/UNC/source/repos/pos-api/`

Flask 3.0 REST API backed by MongoDB (PyMongo).

- Entry point: `app.py` — registers ~60+ Blueprints and route functions
- `app/routes/<domain>/<action>.py` — each CRUD action is its own file (e.g., `app/routes/transaction/create.py`)
- `app/blueprints/` — grouped blueprints for larger sub-systems (cashier reports, branch reports, transactions)
- `app/cas_app/` — Cooperative Accounting System (CAS) sub-application sharing the same Flask process: inventory, purchase orders, chart of accounts, journal entries
- `app/database/config.py` — imports all MongoDB collections as module-level globals; imported directly by route files
- `app/middlewares/token_validator.py` — JWT validation runs as `@app.before_request`; excluded paths include `/login`, `/booking/create`, `/branches`, `/v2/reports`
- `app/config.py` — reads `APP_ENV` env var; valid values: `local-development`, `development`, `internal-production`, `production`
- `proxy/app.py` — Flask reverse proxy (port 5001) that forwards all requests to the local server; also handles legacy HTTP print and display endpoints
- `sync/app.py` — scheduled background process that syncs MongoDB collections between local and remote every 20 seconds (upstream) and 3 minutes (downstream); lookup tables (users, branches, products, etc.) flow downstream only

### Deployment (Docker)

`pos-api/docker-compose.yml` runs five services: `app` (React), `server` (Flask API), `proxy` (Flask proxy), `sync` (data sync), `mongo` (MongoDB). Internal network is `pos-network`. Port map: app→8000, server→8001, proxy→8002, mongo→8003.

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Transaction** — a sale with items, discounts, tender, and status (`completed`, `cancelled`, `refunded`, `on-hold`)
- **Invoice Number** — sequential counter stored in `counters` collection; zero-padded to 6 digits on receipts
- **X-Report** — per-cashier shift summary (time-in to time-out); triggers when cashier clocks out
- **Z-Report** — end-of-day summary across all cashiers; includes accumulated sales, discount breakdown, cash drawer count
- **Electronic Journal** (`ejournal.txt`) — append-only flat-file log of every printed receipt; written by the helper app even when the physical printer is offline
- **Member Discounts** — discounts tied to `memberType` (e.g., `senior_citizen`, `pwd`, `naac`, `solo_parent`); trigger the ID/Signature block at the bottom of the receipt
- **Branch** — the operating location; selected per user session and stored in `localStorage`; drives data scoping throughout the frontend
- **CAS** — Cooperative Accounting System within `pos-api`; separate concern from POS transactions (inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, accounting entries)

---

## Hardware

- **Receipt Printer**: Epson TM-series ESC/POS, connected via TCP/IP. IP address is configurable per `settings.url` in the WebSocket message payload (default: `192.168.192.168`).
- **VFD Customer Display**: Serial RS-232, hardcoded to `COM3` on Windows (`/dev/ttyACM1` on Linux). Uses `\x0C` (form feed) to clear the 2×20 character display.
- Printer failure is non-fatal — the `ReceiptWriter` context manager catches errors and still completes the journal write; the response includes `"message": "Journaled successfully (printer unavailable)"`.
