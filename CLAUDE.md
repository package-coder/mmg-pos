## System Overview

This is the **MMG Albay POS System** monorepo — a point-of-sale system for Medical Mission Group Multipurpose Cooperative-Albay (a healthcare clinic cooperative in the Philippines).

| Directory | Role | Tech |
|---|---|---|
| `mmg-app/` | Frontend SPA | React 18, Vite, MUI v5 |
| `pos-api/` | REST API + hardware proxy + data sync | Flask 3.0, MongoDB, Python |
| `pos-helper-app/` | Hardware bridge (WebSocket server) | Python, websockets, ESC/POS |

### pos-helper-app/helper — `helper/app.py`

A standalone Python `asyncio` WebSocket server that bridges the browser to physical hardware. Runs on every cashier workstation — not in Docker.

- Listens on `ws://localhost:9876`
- Routes JSON messages by `{ "device": "printer"|"display"|"terminal", "device_type": "..." }`
  - Printer types: `receipt`, `report`, `test`
  - Display types: `message`, `item`, `total`, `next`
  - Terminal types: `info` — returns `{ MIN, SN, PTU_NO }` for the current workstation
- All blocking hardware calls use `asyncio.to_thread` to keep the event loop responsive
- `ReceiptWriter` is a context manager that opens `ejournal.txt` once per transaction and writes to both the file and ESC/POS printer simultaneously — journals to file even when the physical printer is offline
- `ejournal.txt` is written next to the running executable (resolved via `sys.executable` when frozen by PyInstaller, `__file__` in dev)
- **BIR terminal credentials** (`MIN`, `SN`, `PTU_NO`) are loaded at startup from `terminal.json` in the same directory as the executable. Not stored in the database — each workstation has its own file. Printed on every receipt and report header.

### mmg-app — `src/`

React 18 + Vite SPA. Key structural layers:

- **`src/api/`** — one Axios module per domain (`transaction.js`, `auth.js`, `print.js`, etc.) using a shared `server` axios instance from `api/index.js` that injects the JWT from `TokenStorage`
- **`src/providers/`** — three React Context providers:
  - `AuthProvider` — JWT auth, user object, selected branch (persisted in `localStorage`)
  - `PrinterProvider` — manages the WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:9876`; exposes `usePrinter()` hook
  - `CashierReportProvider` — cashier shift state
- **`src/routes/`** — React Router v6; four route groups: `MainRoutes` (dashboard/admin), `PosRoutes` (cashier POS screen), `AuthRoutes` (login), `DefaultRoutes` (root redirect). All protected routes use `<AuthorizeRoute roles={[...]}>`.
- **`src/views/pages/PosPage/`** — the active transaction/cashier screen; most hardware interaction happens here via `usePrinter()`
- **`src/store/`** — Redux is used **only** for UI customization (theme). Server state is managed by React Query.
- All pages are lazy-loaded via `Loadable(lazy(...))`.

**Two print paths exist** — know which one you are touching:
1. `usePrinter()` from `PrinterProvider` → WebSocket to helper app (current approach for POS screen)
2. `src/api/print.js` (`Print()`, `PrintReport()`) → HTTP to the proxy `/print` and `/print-report` (legacy, kept for compatibility)

### pos-api — root files + subdirectories

Flask 3.0 REST API backed by MongoDB (PyMongo).

- Entry point: `app.py` — registers ~60+ Blueprints
- `app/routes/<domain>/<action>.py` — each CRUD action is its own file (e.g., `app/routes/transaction/create.py`)
- `app/blueprints/` — grouped blueprints for larger sub-systems
- `app/cas_app/` — Cooperative Accounting System sub-application (inventory, purchase orders, chart of accounts, journal entries) sharing the same Flask process
- `app/database/config.py` — imports all MongoDB collections as module-level globals; imported directly by route files
- `app/middlewares/token_validator.py` — JWT validation as `@app.before_request`; excluded paths include `/login`, `/booking/create`, `/branches`
- `app/config.py` — reads `APP_ENV`; valid values: `local-development`, `development`, `internal-production`, `production`
- `proxy/app.py` — Flask reverse proxy (port 5001) that forwards requests to the local server; also has legacy HTTP print/display endpoints
- `sync/app.py` — scheduled background process syncing MongoDB between local and remote (every 20s upstream, every 3 min downstream). **Will crash-loop on a fresh install if `REMOTE_DATABASE_URL` is a placeholder** — this is harmless and only affects cloud sync; the core POS stack works without it.
- `seed.py` — idempotent seeder: inserts default branch, admin role, and admin user; safe to re-run
- `docker-compose.yml` — five services: `app` (React, :8000), `server` (Flask, :8001), `proxy` (:8002), `sync`, `mongo` (:8003)

## Performance (pos-api server)

### Fix 1 — Gunicorn (replaces Flask dev server)
`pos-api/Dockerfile` runs Gunicorn with 4 workers instead of `python app.py`. This allows the server to handle concurrent requests from multiple cashier terminals in parallel. Set workers to `(2 × CPU cores) + 1` for the branch server machine.

### Fix 2 — MongoDB indexes (`app/database/indexes.py`)
`ensure_indexes()` is called at startup from `app/database/config.py`. It creates compound indexes on the collections that heavy report queries hit:
- `sales`: `(branch, date)` and `(cashierId, date)` — used by cashier sales reports and branch report generation
- `cashier_reports`: `(branchId, date)` — used by `generate_branch_report` aggregation
- `transactions`: `(status, cashierId, date)` and `(branchId, date)` — used by active transaction lookup and general queries
- `branch_reports`: `(branchId, date)` — used to check for existing daily report
- `audit_logs`: `userId` and `datetime` — used by audit log queries

`create_index` is idempotent — safe to call on every startup.

### Fix 3 — Pre-aggregation on write (Option C, already partially implemented)
The `sales` collection is the pre-aggregated write layer — one document is inserted per completed transaction in `app/routes/transaction/update.py`. Report queries (`generate_branch_report`, cashier sales reports) read from `sales` instead of re-aggregating raw `transactions`. This pattern must be maintained: **any new report that can be computed from `sales` should never touch the `transactions` collection directly.**

## Backend Code Architecture (pos-api)

### Rule: All new features use the feature-folder / CSR pattern

New features go under `app/features/<feature_name>/` with four files:

```
app/features/
  transaction/
    routes.py       ← Blueprint + HTTP handlers only (thin)
    service.py      ← all business logic; zero Flask imports
    repository.py   ← all MongoDB calls; zero Flask imports
    models.py       ← Pydantic models for request/response validation
```

**Layer rules — what belongs where:**

| Layer | Responsibility | Must NOT contain |
|---|---|---|
| `routes.py` | Parse request, call service, return response | Business logic, DB calls |
| `service.py` | Business rules, orchestration, calculations | Flask imports, direct DB calls |
| `repository.py` | MongoDB queries, aggregations, data mapping | Business logic, Flask imports |
| `models.py` | Pydantic `BaseModel` shapes for I/O validation | Side effects |

**Concrete example:**

```python
# routes.py — only HTTP concerns
@bp.post('/transaction/complete')
def complete_transaction():
    data = CompleteTransactionRequest(**request.get_json())
    result = service.complete(data, user_id=g.user_id)
    return jsonify(result), 200

# service.py — business logic, no Flask
def complete(data: CompleteTransactionRequest, user_id: str) -> dict:
    invoice_number = repo.get_next_invoice_number()
    transaction = repo.find_one(data.transaction_id)
    # ... discount calculation, sale record creation, etc.
    repo.update(transaction)
    audit_repo.log(AuditCode.TRANSACTION_CREATE, user_id)
    return transaction.to_dict()

# repository.py — DB only, no business logic
def get_next_invoice_number(self) -> int:
    result = db.counters.find_one_and_update(
        {'_id': 'invoiceNumber'},
        {'$inc': {'seq': 1}},
        upsert=True, return_document=True
    )
    return result['seq']
```

**Models:** Use Pydantic `BaseModel` (see `app/new_models/AuditLog.py` as reference). Do not use the old plain-class models in `app/models/`.

**Repository base class:** Extend `app/repositories/base.py` (`BackupRepository`) for collections that need `_sync` support.

**Existing code:** The old pattern (`app/routes/<domain>/<action>.py`) is legacy. Do not extend it for new features — only bugfix in place when needed. Repositories in `app/repositories/` can be reused directly if they already cover your domain.

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Branch: One LAN Server Per Branch + One Shared Staging

```
┌─────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  BRANCH A (LAN)         │     │  BRANCH B (LAN)         │
│  Server + Local MongoDB │     │  Server + Local MongoDB │
│  Cashiers on LAN        │     │  Cashiers on LAN        │
└──────────┬──────────────┘     └──────────┬──────────────┘
           │ upstream sync                  │ upstream sync
           │ (_sync: pending → synced)      │
           ▼                                ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGING / CLOUD                                         │
│  Cloud MongoDB  ◄── aggregate of all branches            │
│  Staging Flask API (read-only enforcement)               │
│  Staging mmg-app (same codebase, VITE_APP_ENV=staging)   │
│  — reports and backup only, no POS/cashier routes        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │ downstream sync
           │ (lookup tables only — branches, users, products, etc.)
           ▼
    Each branch server
```

**Internal (LAN)** — each branch runs its own server (Flask API + MongoDB + sync service + proxy + helper app). Works fully offline. All sales/write operations happen here only.

**Staging/Cloud** — one shared cloud instance that aggregates data from all branch servers. Read-only for reporting and cloud backup. Never generates transactions.

**CAS (Computerized Accounting System)** is a separate project and is not in scope for this sync.

**Deployments:** Currently manual (SSH + `docker-compose up --build`). CI/CD via GitHub Actions is planned.

### Sync Strategy — Embedded `_sync` Field (Outbox Pattern)

Every write operation (create AND update) on upstream collections embeds a `_sync` field directly on the document:

```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "invoiceNumber": 1234,
  "_sync": { "status": "pending", "synced_at": null, "attempts": 0 }
}
```

The sync service polls `{ "_sync.status": "pending" }`, pushes to cloud MongoDB (stripping `_sync` before upsert), then marks `synced` locally.

**Upstream collections** (branch → staging): `transactions`, `cashier_reports`, `branch_reports`, `sales`, `sales_deposits`, `audit_logs`, `bookings`

**Downstream collections** (staging → branch, lookup/config only): `branches`, `users`, `customers`, `discounts`, `packages`, `products`, `product_categories`, `doctors`, `roles`, `corporates`

**Multi-branch safety:** Each document has a globally unique MongoDB `ObjectId`. Multiple branch servers upserting by `_id` on staging is safe and idempotent — no ID collisions, no conflict resolution needed.

**Why embedded `_sync` over a separate `sync_queue` collection:**
Standalone MongoDB has no multi-collection transactions. A separate queue requires two writes (document + queue entry) — a crash between them silently drops the record from sync. Embedding `_sync` is a single atomic write.

**Known limitations:**
- **Stale staging window** — staging lags by up to the sync interval (~20s). Acceptable for end-of-day reports, not for real-time views.
- **Deletes are not propagated** — hard deletes on internal are invisible to staging. Always use status changes (`cancelled`, `refunded`) instead of deletes on upstream collections.
- **Downstream sync must preserve `_sync`** — when the sync service pulls lookup tables from staging → local, it must never overwrite the `_sync` field on existing local documents to avoid resetting pending sync state.

### Staging mmg-app
Same codebase as internal, deployed as a second instance with `VITE_APP_ENV=staging`. This flag disables POS/cashier routes and all write operations — only dashboard and report routes are accessible. Points to the cloud MongoDB via its own `pos-api` instance.

### Cashier Workstation Deployment (pos-helper-app)

pos-helper-app is distributed as a single Windows executable built with PyInstaller. Each cashier PC needs it for receipt printing and VFD display.

**Files distributed per workstation:**
```
mmg-helper.exe      ← built from pos-helper-app/helper/mmg-helper.spec
install.bat         ← one-time installer (pos-helper-app/install.bat)
```

**What `install.bat` does:**
1. Copies `mmg-helper.exe` → `C:\MMG-POS\`
2. Prompts for BIR terminal credentials (MIN, SN, PTU No) and writes `C:\MMG-POS\terminal.json`
3. Creates a Windows Startup shortcut — helper auto-starts on every login
4. Launches the helper immediately

**BIR terminal credentials** are per-workstation, stored only in `C:\MMG-POS\terminal.json`. They are never stored in MongoDB. Edit the file and restart the helper to update credentials after BIR approval.

```json
{ "MIN": "123-456789-0", "SN": "S/N0000012345", "PTU_NO": "PTU-000000000001" }
```

**Receipt fields and their source:**

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| MIN, SN, PTU No (header) | `terminal.json` on workstation |
| Accred No, Supplier PTU (footer) | `dvoteDetails` from DB |

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Transaction** — a sale with items, discounts, tender, and status (`completed`, `cancelled`, `refunded`, `on-hold`)
- **Invoice Number** — sequential counter stored in `counters` collection; zero-padded to 6 digits on receipts
- **X-Report** — per-cashier shift summary (time-in to time-out)
- **Z-Report** — end-of-day summary across all cashiers; includes accumulated sales, discount breakdown, cash drawer count
- **Electronic Journal** (`ejournal.txt`) — append-only flat-file log of every non-reprint receipt; written by the helper app even when printer is offline
- **Member Discounts** — tied to `memberType` (`senior_citizen`, `pwd`, `naac`, `solo_parent`); triggers the ID/Signature block on receipts
- **Branch** — selected per user session in `localStorage`; scopes data throughout the frontend
- **Role names** — must match the constants in `mmg-app/src/utils/Role.js` (case-insensitive): `admin`, `cashier`, `manager`. A user with any other role name will be bounced to /404 by `AuthorizeRoute`.
- **CAS** — Cooperative Accounting System within `pos-api`; separate concern from POS (inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, accounting)

---

## Hardware

- **Receipt Printer**: Epson TM-series ESC/POS over TCP/IP. IP is configurable via the `settings.url` field in the WebSocket message (default: `192.168.192.168`).
- **VFD Customer Display**: RS-232 serial, `COM3` on Windows / `/dev/ttyACM1` on Linux. Uses `\x0C` (form feed) to clear the 2×20 character display.
- Printer failure is non-fatal — `ReceiptWriter` catches errors and completes the journal write; response returns `"message": "Journaled successfully (printer unavailable)"`.
